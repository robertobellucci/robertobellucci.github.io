I am a PhD student at the [Bonn Graduate School of Economics](https://www.econ.uni-bonn.de/bgse/en/doctoral-program). I am interested in Microeconomic Theory.

You can find my CV [here](https://robertobellucci.github.io/files/RobertoCV.pdf).


Previously, I studied Economics at the University of Turin, and I also had the privilege to be an Allievo at [Collegio Carlo Alberto](https://www.carloalberto.org/education/allievi-honors-program/overview/). My master thesis was about Social Choice. I studied some issues on *utilitarianism when people are uncertian about how to compare utilities, and when utilities are not even fully comparable*. 

At the moment, I am having fun studying some Mechanism Design!

# **Research interests**
* **(Robust) Mechanism Design**,
* **Social Choice - Utilitarianism**,
* **Incomplete Information Games**.
