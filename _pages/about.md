I am a Ph.D. student at the [Bonn Graduate School of Economics](https://www.econ.uni-bonn.de/bgse/en/doctoral-program). You can find my CV [here](https://robertobellucci.github.io/files/RobertoBellucciCV.pdf).


Previously, I studied Economics at the University of Turin, and I had the privilege to be an [Allievo](https://www.carloalberto.org/education/allievi-honors-program/overview/) at Collegio Carlo Alberto. My master thesis was about Social Choice. I studied some issues on *utilitarianism when people are uncertian about how to compare utilities, and when utilities are not even fully comparable*. 

At the moment, I am having fun studying Mechanism Design!

# Research Interest:
* **(Robust) Mechanism Design** 
* **Social Choice - Utilitarianism** 
* **Incomplete Information Games**

Feel free to reach me at `roberto.bellucci@carloalberto.org` if you would like to have a chat about any of these!!
